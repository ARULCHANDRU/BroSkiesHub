# DAY 1 
## Calculator CLI App - BH Python Developer Internship Task 1

[cite_start]This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) calculator built with Python. 

## Objective
[cite_start]The main objective was to create a calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

## How it Works
- [cite_start]The script uses functions for each mathematical operation. 
- [cite_start]It runs in a loop that continuously prompts the user to select an operation. 
- [cite_start]The user's input is captured to perform the calculation, and the result is displayed. 
- [cite_start]The loop terminates when the user chooses to exit. 

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command: `python calculator.py`

# DAY 2
# Task 2: Python Console To-Do List

This repository contains the solution for the BH Python Developer Internship Task 2.

## Objective
The objective is to implement a simple, console-based to-do list manager using Python.

## Features
- **View Tasks:** Users can view all their current tasks.
- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their list.
- **Remove Tasks:** Users can remove a task from the list.
- **Persistence:** The application stores all tasks in a `tasks.txt` file, so the data is not lost when the program closes.

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Clone this repository or download the `todo.py` file.
3.  Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4.  Run the command: `python todo.py`
