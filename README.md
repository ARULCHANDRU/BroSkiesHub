## Calculator CLI App - BH Python Developer Internship Task 1

[cite_start]This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) calculator built with Python. 

## Objective
[cite_start]The main objective was to create a calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

## How it Works
- [cite_start]The script uses functions for each mathematical operation. 
- [cite_start]It runs in a loop that continuously prompts the user to select an operation. 
- [cite_start]The user's input is captured to perform the calculation, and the result is displayed. 
- [cite_start]The loop terminates when the user chooses to exit. 

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command: `python calculator.py`
